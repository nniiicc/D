In more recent evolutionary versions of public goods games, which simulate simple decisions about collective action problems similar to the prisoners dilemma but over long periods of time, researchers have focused on how social diversity enables the emergence of cooperation  - showing that, counterintuitively, contributions to a public pool are more consistent in groups that are more socially diverse (2008), and that cooperators and defectors can successfully coexist in public goods games where population density is high (Huart, Holmes, Doebelie ; for a through overview see Perc)

In field-based work, studies of free riding, and the emergence of cooperation in collective action dilemmas have been studied widely. In the early 1980's Acheson studied lobster fisheries in Maine, showing that the temptation to poach or over harvest lobsters was remedied by a series of nested rules - some established by gaming and wildlife commissions at the state level, and others at the community (dock) level where "lobster gangs" would enforce social norms through intimidation, and punishment. During this same period, Ostrom studied long-enduring Spanish Huertas - fertile areas of farm and garden land along riversides- showing that a variety of governance structures could achieve the same cooperative outcome. Ostrom's work focused on how physical attributes of the resource system impacted governance structures, and consequently how these commons were sustained through a "polycentric" system - nesting informal rules within formal local and state government laws - modified over a five hundred year period, which included both political upheaval and numerous transfers of land ownership (1990). Hundreds of studies followed Ostrom's seminal work on common-pool resources, many refining the nuances of her design principles (discussed in detail in Chapter 3) - and many extending her work to socio-economic and socio-ecological resource systems (Folke et al, Young et al , for an extensive list of studies, see Ostrom 2005 p. 8-9). 

Field based research in systems that are not physical - that is where free-riding and tragedies are studied in commons that are made up of digital resources (including virtual, knowledge, creative, or scientific commons) are not without precedence. Early work on collaboratories in CSCW produced the idea of a "virtual commons" applied to Usenet - a popular distributed discussion forum on the internet. In this work, Kollock and Smith use the design principles generated by Ostrom (1990) to describe how both free riding and cooperation are made easier in computer mediated communication systems - the effect being a more volatile and dynamic environment for collective action problems (1996). 

However, a majority of this literature is focused on two settings: open source software development, and the canonical example of Wikipedia. In the former, von Hippel and Krough studied participation in OSS projects extensively, noting how free-riding was identified, and outed in early OSS projects like . In many instances they focus on the ways that private interests (and paid participants) are able to coexist with public interests (volunteers) - in fact one of the defining success markers of a large OSS project is its ability to manage these two broadly conceived stakeholder groups (2003). In the latter, Wikipedia, much of the early work on this platform as a form of peer production focused on content producers, and the governance that sustained their participation in the project (i.e. Voss, 2005). Interestingly, free riding on Wikipedia is assumed to be pervasive - there are many more visitors (readers) of the site than there are registered or active contributors (editors). Antin and Cheshire's work shows that a majority of readers have incomplete information about how to edit articles, and low confidence in their ability to correctly use MediaWiki editing software (2010), - therefore, all readers cannot be assumed to free riding in the sense that they are taking advantage of others work without reciprocating. This is a nuanced, but important point as there are many more users of ICOADS than there are contributors - finding ways to understand the asymmetries of users with knowledge of the data, software, they way it is produced, and how they can make improvements to ICOADS, and those that lack this knowledge is an important aspect of the case study that I outline in chapter three. 

While altruism, reciprocity and rules are shown to be important aspects of overcoming the free-rider problem,  many questions remain about the dynamics of collective action situations over time, and how such approaches are able to evolve and adapt to various aspects of the problem over time (Ostrom, 2000 p, 138).
