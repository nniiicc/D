#Abstract 

This dissertation addresses problems of collective action that result from the sharing and pooling of climate science research objects managed as public goods. Through a case study of a long-standing  project, the International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS), I describe how cooperation  emerged and has been sustained amongst diversely motivated groups over a thirty year period; and how recent political events have impacted these collaborations.

I argue that current models of organizing and funding this type of collaborative work fail to accommodate a form of knowledge production that depends upon the pooling and sharing of resources across traditional institutional and organizational boundaries.  

Drawing on past studies of common-pool resource management, I propose a framework that will support the comparative, and longitudinal study of these complex sociotechnical systems. I apply this framework to ICOADS, and discuss its success and limitations as a diagnostic tool. 

The thesis of this dissertation is that peer production and the shared management of research objects as public goods are increasingly important aspects of systems-based sciences, and it is important to understand how they evolve and change over time if future science and technology policies are to move beyond simple panaceas for the sustainability of sociotechnical systems.
