##Chapter Two Summary

Come back to idea of identifying spillovers... 

In 1990, Elinor Ostrom wrote that "We do not yet have the necessary intellectual tools or models to understand the array of problems that are associated with governing and managing natural resource systems and the reasons why some institutions seem to work in some settings and not others." In the above statement, if we simply replace natural resource systems with sociotechnical systems then much of the same remains true today. In designing collaborative projects to manage and share digital resources as public goods, we do not have much generalizable knowledge about why some governance structures work, and other do not; and crucially, we do not understand how these systems evolve and change over time such that we can design their governance structures to be flexible and amenable - sustainable - to the types of changes that allow for sociotechnical systems to benefit future generations of users. 

The work above demonstrates that 

Part of the problem is a shift in focus of study, so that we are able to capture and record "the unintended effects of particular policy interventions, so that dangerous combinations of policies devised at diverse tiers or attributable to particular aspects of a resource system and resource units can be avoided."
