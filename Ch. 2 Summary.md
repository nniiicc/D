In 1990, Elinor Ostrom wrote that "We do not yet have the necessary intellectual tools or models to understand the array of problems that are associated with governing and managing natural resource systems and the reasons why some institutions seem to work in some settings and not others." If we simply replace natural resource systems with sociotechnical systems, much of the same is true. We do not have much generalizable knowledge about why some governance structures work, and other do not, and crucially, we do not understand how these systems evolve and change over time such that we can design their governance structures to be flexible and amenable to the types of changes that allow for sociotechnical systesm to be sustained for benefit of future generations of users.
