##Summary

Both of the scientometric studies described above were ultimately rejected by the subjects they were attempting to measure - with the curators of ICOADS demonstrating how and why a metric based analysis of users would be limited in measuring the impact of their work, and the scientists whom used and extended ICOADS telling us how much of the family we were missing in creating a geneaology. 

In January of 2012, when NOAA had first announced the defunding of ESRL many had predicted a very difficult time for the future of ICOADS -some questioning whether it would survive at all. And yet, in my two years of working with, and studying this community I never saw anyone lose access (save a brief government shut-down in the fall of 2013). The question this begged, in my mind, was how the 

In 1990, Elinor Ostrom wrote that "We do not yet have the necessary intellectual tools or models to understand the array of problems that are associated with governing and managing natural resource systems and the reasons why some institutions seem to work in some settings and not others." In the above statement, if we simply replace natural resource systems with sociotechnical systems then much of the same remains true today. In designing collaborative projects to manage and share resources as public goods, we do not have much generalizable knowledge about why some governance structures work, and other do not; and crucially, we do not understand how these systems evolve and change over time such that we can design their governance structures to be flexible and amenable to the types of changes that allow for sociotechnical systesm to be sustained for benefit of future generations of users.
