##Chapter Two Summary

I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT RELEVANCE THIS CHAPTER HAS ON MY OVERALL THESIS BUT I DID A LOT OF WORK AND DIDN'T WANT TO SIMPLY THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL.

In 1990, Elinor Ostrom wrote that "We do not yet have the necessary intellectual tools or models to understand the array of problems that are associated with governing and managing natural resource systems and the reasons why some institutions seem to work in some settings and not others." In the above statement, if we simply replace natural resource systems with sociotechnical systems then much of the same remains true today. In designing collaborative projects to manage and share resources as public goods, we do not have much generalizable knowledge about why some governance structures work, and other do not; and crucially, we do not understand how these systems evolve and change over time such that we can design their governance structures to be flexible and amenable to the types of changes that allow for sociotechnical systems to be sustained for benefit of future generations of users.
