###1.1. Cynics

In May of 2013, the House of Representatives’ Committee on Space, Science and Technology held two hearings titled “Restoring U.S. Leadership in Weather Forecasting.” Private industry leaders, academic experts and federal agency administrators gave testimony about potential ways to improve the USA’s response time to extreme weather events (e.g. hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes). The hope of Republican leadership on the committee was to gather input for legislation on how existing budget allocations for the National Ocean and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) could be used to improve weather forecasting, and in particular numerical weather prediction (NWP) capabilities. 

The desire to improve NWP was prompted by events of Hurricane Sandy in the fall of 2012. During this storm, a set of NWP models at the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) more accurately predicted the inland turn of the storm than did either of NOAA’s weather service centers (Mass, 2012). This set of hearings asked participants why weather forecasting experts had failed to measure up to their European counterparts, and what could be done to remedy the situation using federal research monies. 

Two months after the hearings a bill was introduced to the House of Representatives that proposed the following:

*To prioritize and redirect NOAA resources to a focused program of investment on near-term, affordable, and attainable advances in observational, computing, and modeling capabilities to deliver substantial improvement in
weather forecasting and prediction of high impact weather events, such as tornadoes and hurricanes, and for other purposes. (H.R. 2413)*

Members of the House of Reresentatives “Subcommittee on the Environment” objected, noting that without increasing budget appropriations for NOAA the bill amounted to an unfunded mandate that would dramatically impact various essential functions performed by the National Weather Service (NWS), and would devastate NOAA’s climate research portfolio.

To get the bill out of committee a deal was brokered between Republications and Democrats to remove the language that implied NOAA would have to use existing federal budget allocations. Instead, Congress would allocate an additional $350 million for NOAA’s 2015-2017 operating budget.

While the bill avoided congressional re-appropriation of existing federal research funds, it still included a considerable amount of oversight for how funds  were to be spent, and how individuals would be held accountable for making progress on what are substantive basic research problems. Steps towards regulating NOAA’s spending of these funds would include regular reporting by NOAA’s Director to congress on the status and improvement of weather prediction forecasting and “fundamental understanding of the weather”, directions for the CIO of NOAA to draft and make available for public comment a report on “computing resource prioritization,” and the establishment of a “weather research and innovation advisory committee” that would annually report to the Committee on Space, Science and Technology about NOAA’s progress in meeting the priorities described in the bill. 

Dr. Cliff Mass of the University of Washington, an expert in numerical weather prediction models and one of the most outspoken critics of NOAA’s weather forecasting performance described the bill as follow:

On the one hand, it’s strange Congress has to be this prescriptive. On the other hand I can understand that, given the failures of management in NOAA from the lack of investment in computers to the lack of evaluation of satellite and other observing systems. (Washington Post, 2014).

In April of 2014, the bill now known as the “Weather Forecasting Improvement Act Of 2014 (H.R. 2413)” passed a simple majority vote in the House of Representatives, and is currently in the Senate, having been assigned to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 

Myths of H.R 2413


H.R. 2413 embodies a number of myths that surround science policy and the federal subsidy of basic science research, notably what Dan Sarewitz calls the “myth of infinite benefit” and the “myth of accountability.” 

The myth of infinite benefit is the assumption that an increase in federal funding will result in progress on basic science research problems – setting up an impossible scenario where more money automatically equals better science which should in turn produce greater societal benefits. 

The myth of accountability assumes that by enforcing controls on the quality of scientific research that scientists will react positively, and ethically. In this scenario, where the ethics of science and scientists have failed, oversight and surveillance can become a de-facto moral compass (1996, p. 10). 

H.R 2413 also represents the prototypical cynical approach to organizing basic science research. It sees progress on substantive research questions as having a calculable price. In the case of H.R. 2413, if the USA needs to bridge a NWP gap between current state, and state of the art then the answer is simply increased funding. More importantly – the cynical approach also sees the role of a central authority as the only way to eliminate inefficiencies in basic science research, bringing a Taylorist bureaucratic accounting practice into the 21st century. 
 
##1.2 Sentimentalists

“… we’re making even more government data available, and we’re making it easier for people to find and to use.  And that’s going to help launch more start-ups.  It’s going to help launch more businesses…It’s going to help more entrepreneurs come up with products and services that we haven’t even imagined yet. This kind of innovation and ingenuity has the potential to transform the way we do almost everything.”

*President Barak Obama, May 9, 2013 after announcing an executive order titled “Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information”*


####“…transform the way we do almost everything” ?

The global economic crisis of 2009 has had a profound impact on what was already stagnant funding for basic science research - turning what was an already difficult  The following anecdotes emphasize what is the opposite of a cynical approach to organizing basic science research – seeing an absurd value in corporate sponsorship, and knowing little about the steep price to be paid by slashing basic science research funding: 

- Joint winner of the 2013 Nobel prize in medicine, Randy Schekman, noted that in the USA, "The budget of the NIH has declined in purchasing power by about 28 percent over the last 7 to 8 years...I doubt very much that in today's environment I would have been able to do the work I did in the early 5 to 10 years that led to my sitting here today and, more importantly the discoveries that resulted from it."(quoted in Austin, 2013).  A study by the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice proved his point; that the average age of a first time NIH grantee in 2008 was 42, and over the last 30 years the average age at which a Nobel prize winner completed their award winning research was 41 (Matthews, 2011).

- Amid efforts to balance a federal budget in Canada, the minister of state for science and technology, Gary Goodyear, said the National Research Council had begun to “lose its focus” and instead of redirecting or refocusing the agency, it would be “transformed into a one-stop shop for businesses and offer concierge services to link businesses with federal programs aimed at boosting innovation.” (Hoag, 2012). Funding for basic science research has declined at a rate of nearly 20% per year since Goodyear made that statement. 

- In 2011, then Prime Minister of the UK, David Cameron said in a speech, “Life sciences is a jewel in the crown of our economy. It has consistently shown stronger growth than the UK as a whole.” For such crowning achievements UK universities and research funding faced a potential decrease in funding, estimated at  £600 million ($903 million) the previous year (Arthur and Piatt, 2010). To make up for the gap, it was strongly suggested that basic science research needs to do better at bridging the “transfer gap” to

- In March of 2014, the White House announced a new “data imitative” aimed at making climate and weather data more accessible, more usable, and more central to urban, agricultural and private industry decision making. Besides simply adding another tab to the data.gov website, the initiative was to engage private industry and philanthropic partners through “extensive open government data and design competitions” (Holden and Polesta, 2014).  Design competitions whose winning stakes were, it seems, access to better computational infrastructure provided by private companies, including:

**   Microsoft Research — would provide12 months of free Azure cloud-computing access to the top 40 scientists and policy makers of design competitions
* - - * Google — would provide 50 million hours worth HPC, and 1PB worth of cloud storage to the climate community based on design competition winners. Worth noting, this wouldn’t even store half of the data used to produce the most recent IPCC AR report.
- - Intel Corporation — would sponsor three “hackathon” events that would award new hardware to the winners. 
- - ESRI — would build an online portal for finding climate and weather related GIS data. Much of the data would be proprietary, but users were more than welcome to pay ESRI for access. 


For sentimentalists, the funding crisis of science can be remedied through privatization, through increased commoditization of its intellectual outputs, and through a closer, more expedient marriage with private industry. The sentimental approach doesn’t see a central governance regime as being the most efficient way to protect its investment, but instead the free market where incentives are predicated on self-interested individuals competing with one another for increasingly small pots of grant funding, and tying their work even more explicitly to corporate, profit-based interests.  

###Between Cynics and Sentimentalists

Both of the caricatures sketched above -the cynical and the sentiemental- are based on the assumption that people, whether they are NOAA sponsored scientists to open-data hackers, act primarily out of self-interest. Where cynics see the need to govern and formalize rules so as to guard against the selfish actions of these people, sentimentalists see the opportunity to capitalize on this selfishness by providing marketplaces where winners and loser will be “naturally” borne out. 

The cynical view stresses the need to govern and contract with the state in order to achieve progress in a collective action situation. Where two or more entities need to cooperate to achieve a shared goal, the most effective way to insure that one does not exploit the other is through government intervention and oversight. The theoretical underpinnings of this position are influenced heavily by the likes of Thomas Hobbes. 

The sentimental view assumes that funding shortfalls and disputes about the price of goods will be borne out in the exchange of self-serving actors. The  theoretical underpinnings of this approach might be loosely called “economic”, and are often attributed to Adam Smith and his writings in “Wealth of Nations”

Over the last three decades sociologists, economists and political scientists have begun to recognize many alternative solutions collective action problems -  Common-pool resource management of public lands (), and Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects () are just a few examples of collective action scenarios where a mechanism for organizing work, sharing goods and distributing credit have achieved high levels of sustained success by operating outside of absolute marketplaces, or the hierarchical rule of firms and states.  

This view takes a looser interpretation of selfishness, and instead locates incentives for cooperation and volunteerism in actors that are also forward thinking and diversely motivated. This is not to say that there is some new, altruistic fever of people and technologies working together to solve shared problems, but simply that there is more to motivation than self-interestedness.

The cynical and the sentimental are also products of a post-normal science scenario where values are in dispute, stakes are high, decisions are urgent, and facts are uncertain (Funtowitz and Ravetz, 1993). Post-normal science is defined against what Thomas Kuhn called normal science; the period between scientific revolutions that was marked by a blind acceptance of a theory. In normal science uncertainties are managed or dismissed, values are unspoken, and complications with existing theories are left partially or wholly unexplored (1968). Post-normal is not the opposite of normal science, it is to help explain research settings like climate science that are predicated on uncertainty, where values are not only voiced, but in dispute amongst scientists, the general public and politicians. Post-normal science offer an explanation of research that is neither revolutionary nor stable - but marked by its complex and interdependent nature.  

In this dissertation, I use a case study approach to describe a long standing collaboration, the International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS), that has solved collective action problems over a thirty year period (1984-2014). Although the particular details of this case are unique, I attempt to show how this case is representative of many successful institutions in a post-normal paradigm of science where a middle path is tread between the cynical and the sentimental – nesting the freedom to self-organize and contract directly with one another within existing traditional, and hierarchically governed organizations. 

The point of this extended characterization is to describe unique aspects of the cooperative production, maintenance and use of ICOADS, but also to project many of these qualities onto the future organization and management of shared resources in similar settings. I argue that we can see ICOADS as an institutional arrangement, a kind of sociotechnical system, that will become more prevalent in the coming years; both as a result of shrinking federal support for basic science research and consequently the need to pool shared resources, but also more practically to tackle the types of systems-based grand challenge science problems that we face as a society in a post-normal paradigm. The research questions that this case study addresses are:


>**RQ1.** How does ICOADS, as an institution for collective action, sustain successful cooperative arrangements in a post-normal paradigm?, and 

>**RQ2.** How has the governance and resource sharing arrangements of ICOADS evolved over time in response to external pressures from funding agencies, the politicization of the climate change, and rapid technological change? 

A major argument in this proposal is that social scientists studying sociotechnical systems, cyberinfrastructure development, data sharing and reuse, and eScience collaboration more generally have thus far failed to provide an adequate base of knowledge for decision makers to consult when faced with questions about the necessary policy interventions, likely success or sustainability needs of these types of institutions. This is not because these domains lack in high quality research, nor important findings, but because too often a new technology or collaboration is studied for generic design implications, rather than policy consequences (Jackson, Steinhardt and Buyhkter, 2013; Jackson et al. 2014). This shift requires, as Elinor Ostrom once put it, that we study and record  "the unintended effects of particular policy interventions, so that dangerous combinations of policies devised at diverse tiers or attributable to particular aspects of a resource system and resource units can be avoided." (2007, p. )In short, if we are to move beyond simple panaceas for solving complex interrelated problems in sustaining sociotechnical systems then a comprehensive analytical framework is needed to address interactions between different types of variables (resources, users, technologies) and different levels of interactions (institutional, organizational, funding agency, etc.) - one that is flexible enough to be used in a variety of settings, and yet rigid enough to produce studies that are comparable to one another in meaningful ways. My third research question then is methodological, in asking  

>**RQ3.** How can analytical frameworks successful for studying collective action problems in other settings be modified for sociotechnical settings where issues of sustainability, cooperation and shared resource management are diverse and shifting over time?  

In the rest of this chapter, I argue that these are particularly salient questions to ask about institutions that are facing budget crises as a result of the politicization of climate research and that the International Ocean and Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) is an especially valuable case to explore these questions. To do so, I present results from three different studies of ICOADS that led me to these questions.
