#Chapter Three
<br>
In chapter two I begin by defining concepts which are important to the study of cooperation, collective action and the unique ways in which ICOADS is produced and managed as a public good. I demonstrate that many of the findings from research into these topics can be integrated with studies of data sharing, reuse and cyberinfrastructure development found in information science and CSCW.

I use these overlaps to suggest that an analytical framework for studying the evolution and sustainability of sociotechnical systems, like ICOADS, should be developed to better understand the complex political, social and economic settings in which they are embedded.
