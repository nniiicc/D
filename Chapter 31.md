#Chapter 3

##Introduction
<br>
In chapter three, I first describe a range of research methods that can be used to study peer-produced commons, collective action, and sustainbility. I begin first by explaining how this work will overcome limitations with the case study approach. I then describe the design and procedure for a case study of ICOADS, and how it will be used to test a proposed framework of sociotechnical systems. At the end of this chapter, I describe the overall contribution of this research, and a schedule of completion.

##Empirical Social Science
<br>
Conducting empirical research in the social sciences is often a trade-off between some combination of available time, money, skills, and material resources. Each of these factors present a researcher with a choice between one way of collecting or analyzing data and a number of alternatives â€“ each may be cheaper, faster, easier or more appropriate than the other. 

Generically, we can situate tradeoffs between data collection and analysis in a two dimensional matrix; in one dimension we can place the choice of an empirical research method, and in another dimension we can place the use of a theoretical descriptive technique (see Figure 6 ).
