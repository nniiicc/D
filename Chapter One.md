#Chapter One
<br>

The cooperation and coordination of different scientific cultures is increasingly important in contemporary research settings. This especially true in domains such as the earth sciences where the reuse of others data, software, instruments and infrastructures is necessary to comprehensively study interconnected physical systems. In this context, the pooling and sharing of resources across diverse organizational settings can be seems as a form of collective action, or "action taken by multiple people in pursuit of the same goal or collective good" \cite{oliver1993critical}. Because most contemporary scientific work is funded through government subsidies it is crucial to understand how - in practice -these collaborative projects are organized to solve collective action problems, and the effectiveness of science and technology policy to meet these ends. 

In this chapter, I describe two influential views of organizing, managing and funding knowledge production in basic science research; I refer to these two approaches as the cynical and the sentimental. I then describe how and why the cynical and the sentimental models are incompatible with the kinds of broad cooperation required to sustain collaborations that share and pool resources across traditional organizational boundaries.
