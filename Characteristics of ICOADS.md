Collective action problems solved through peer produced science commons - we know none of the particulars for ICOADS - how these things are practically achieved - what we have at best is an outline of the salient and important things to look out for - or the beginnings of a framework for studying the sustainbility of institutions that 

While many fields have studied these problems independently (more below) few studies have synthesized the concepts (e.g. Benkler, 2006; Schweick and English, 2012). 

Most important in doing this is to bring IAD from Ostrom to bear on these problems. 

(then show overlap of studies using symbolic interaction (explicitly or not) and functional roots of IAD. 

Then end with bringing in peripheral studies of research data sharing... 

Eschenfelder and Johnson used a very loose form of IAD looked at repositories that restrict use of a resource, calling these institutions “controlled data collections” (CDC). They drew explicitly on the institutional scholars work in commons, in arguing for CDC’s as a conceptual knowledge commons, asking how CDCs  determine “operational rules” that grant access to data users.  (Ostrom & Hess, 2007).
