##Commons
<br>

In open science the alternative to a private intellectual property are commons property regimes, which are rules and norms for the governance of resources that "require larger scale utilization than would be efficient in small, individually-owned parcels" (Benkler, 2014). In many settings, commons are the institutionalist method of critiquing the neoclassical model of property (Hess and Ostrom, 2003; as quoted in Benkler, 2014).


In these settings the operational structure allowing for access, use and ownership of a shared resource is distributed amongst the stakeholders of those resources- 

Some of the most recognizable forms of commons can be found in the shared maintenance of natural resources, such as Atlantic Cod fisheries (Hutchings & Myers, 1994), Maineâ€™s lobster industry (Acheson, 1994), and livestock grazing pastures all over the world (Ostrom, Burger, Field, Norgaard & Policansky, 1999). Increasingly, commons regimes are used to explain the complex property rights around collections of digital assets that, in an open science paradigm, require more flexible intellectual property rights than are typically afforded physical objects (Hess and Ostrom, 2007). Some of the most salient examples of commons in contemporary society are Wikipedia, AP News, and open source software projects like Linux or Apache (Benkler, 2011; Madison, Freshman and Strandburg, 2011)

A heuristic tool for understanding the nature of any commons arrangement is to analyze how a shared resource is able to be accessed, and the rivalry that this access creates amongst its users. To understand rivalry we can ask questions like 'Is there competition for the resource? Is the resource finite, or renewable? Can the resources be simultaneously accessed and owned by two or more individuals? (i.e. scallops in a bay create rivalry; air in the atmosphere does not). In there other dimension, we can ask questions about excludability of a resource, such as 'Can potential users of commons be denied access (either by physical means or on moral grounds)? (i.e. A country club is exclusive, while a public library is non-exclusive).'

Using these two characteristics of a resource we can situate almost any commons arrangement in the following matrix:
