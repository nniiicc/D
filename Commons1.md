Elinor Ostrom's early work on common-pool resources and their governance structures (1990) was the foundation for much of the scholarship that followed, including concepts that extended or modified her work, including the anticommons,” (Heller 1998) “semicommons,” (Smith 2001),  “creative commons,” “contractually reconstructed commons,” (Reichman & Uhlir 2003) “liberal commons,” (Dagan & Heller 2001) and, “culturally constructed commons.” (Madison,
Frischmann & Strandburg, 2010) (As described by Benkler, 2014). 

In this proposal my focus is on public goods, where the management of resource or service has low levels of both rivalry and excludability. Increasingly, scientific works that are funded through government subsidies (e.g. journal publications, data, models etc) are considered public goods - although the excludability of access to these resources remains highly contested (Wilbanks, ). Recent policy developed by the White House   

Intellectual property laws are meant to encourage the production of public goods (which are by their nature difficult to otherwise restrict) by erecting artificial, legal barriers to copying, distributing and sharing these types of materials. Where appropriate, I will discuss intellectual property law, but for the most part I avoid discussions of formal laws by focusing on public goods which are to remain in the public sphere, and are therefore governed by informal rules and community norms. 

In a public goods setting, commons are congruent with an open science alternative to market based incentives. As Bolier put it, this approach "...provides a coherent alternative model for bringing economic, social, and ethical concerns into greater alignment. It is able to talk about the inalienability of certain resources and the value of protecting community interests. The commons fills a theoretical void by explaining how significant value can be created and sustained outside of the market system." (2005 p. 27).
