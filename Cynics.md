##Cynics  
<br>
In May of 2013, the House of Representatives’ Committee on Space, Science and Technology held two hearings titled “Restoring U.S. Leadership in Weather Forecasting.” Private industry leaders, academic experts and federal agency administrators gave testimony about potential ways to improve the USA’s response time to extreme weather events (e.g. hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes). The hope of Republican leadership on the committee was to gather input for legislation on how existing budget allocations for the National Ocean and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) could be used to improve weather forecasting, and in particular numerical weather prediction (NWP) capabilities. 

The desire to improve NWP was prompted by extreme events that took place during Hurricane Sandy in the fall of 2012. During this storm, a set of NWP models at the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) more accurately predicted the inland turn of the storm than did either of NOAA’s weather service centers (Mass, 2012). This set of hearings asked participants why weather forecasting experts had failed to measure up to their European counterparts, and what could be done to remedy the situation using federal research monies. 

Two months after the hearings a bill was introduced to the House of Representatives that proposed the following:

> To prioritize and redirect NOAA resources to a focused program of investment on near-term, affordable, and attainable advances in observational, computing, and modeling capabilities to deliver substantial improvement in
> weather forecasting and prediction of high impact weather events, such as tornadoes and hurricanes, and for other purposes. (H.R. 2413)

Members of the House of Reresentatives “Subcommittee on the Environment” objected, noting that without increasing budget appropriations for NOAA the bill amounted to an unfunded mandate that would dramatically impact various essential functions performed by the National Weather Service (NWS), and would devastate NOAA’s climate research portfolio.

To get the bill out of committee a deal was brokered between Republications and Democrats to remove the language that implied NOAA would have to use existing federal budget allocations. Instead, Congress would allocate an additional $350 million for NOAA’s 2015-2017 operating budget.

While the bill avoided congressional re-appropriation of existing research funds, it still included an innordinate amount of oversight for how money was to be spent, and how individuals would be held accountable for making progress on what are substantive basic research problems. Steps towards regulating NOAA’s spending of these funds included 

+ regular reporting by NOAA’s Director to Congress on the status and improvement of weather prediction forecasting and how the agency was making advances on a “fundamental understanding of the weather”
+ directions for the CIO of NOAA to draft and make available for public comment a report on “computing resource prioritization” , and 
+ the establishment of a “weather research and innovation advisory committee” that would annually report to the Committee on Space, Science and Technology about NOAA’s progress in meeting the priorities described in the bill. 

Dr. Cliff Mass of the University of Washington, an expert in numerical weather prediction models and one of the most outspoken critics of NOAA’s weather forecasting performance, described the bill as follow:

> On the one hand, it’s strange Congress has to be this prescriptive. On the other hand I can understand that, given the failures of management in NOAA from the lack of investment in computers to the lack of evaluation of satellite and other observing systems. (Washington Post, 2014).

In April of 2014, the bill now known as the “Weather Forecasting Improvement Act Of 2014 (H.R. 2413)” passed a simple majority vote in the House of Representatives, and is currently in the Senate, having been assigned to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 

###Myths of H.R 2413
<br>
H.R. 2413 embodies a number of myths that surround science policy and the federal subsidy of basic science research, notably what Dan Sarewitz calls the “myth of infinite benefit” and the “myth of accountability.” 

The myth of infinite benefit is the assumption that an increase in federal funding will result in progress on basic science research problems – setting up an impossible scenario where more money automatically equals better science which should in turn produce greater societal benefits. 

The myth of accountability assumes that by enforcing controls on the quality of scientific research that scientists will react positively, and ethically. In this scenario, where the ethics of science and scientists have failed, oversight and surveillance can become a de-facto moral compass (1996, p. 10). 

These two myths embody what I call the cynical approach to organizing, funding and evaluating basic science research; It sees progress on substantive research questions as having a calculatable price, and it sees inefficiency and accountability only in terms of cost. In the context of H.R. 2413, if the USA needs to bridge a NWP gap between current state, and state of the art then the answer is more funding, and more oversight.
