The choice between different approaches to empirical research presents a trade-off between what I call "dirty" or "clean" methods.

+ Clean empirical methods are characterized by narrowly scoped research questions, highly organized and rigorous approaches to data collection, and depend upon well established thresholds of significance for the acceptance or rejection of a research result.

+ Dirty empirical research methods are, inversely, characterized by broad research questions, opportunistic and informal data collection, and the use of subjective judgment about the relevance of a research finding.

The other dimension of this matrix presents a trade-off between theories used to analyze a research finding, and can be characterized as producing either a “thin” or “thick” set of descriptions. 

+ Thin theoretical descriptions often take the form of a framework that makes the content of an explanation easily accessible to the reader. Thin descriptions might use a narrowly defined theory to explain research findings, or a set of "most likely" explanations applied to selected research results.

+ Thick descriptions often include a set of emergent or broad theories about the embedded and situated context in which some thing obtains meaning, or value. T

Thin descriptions lack depth in explaining a broader context of a phenomena being studied, and are often unconcerned with the "how and why" - such is the characterization of traditional scientometric work. 

Thick descriptions offer dense, non-linear narratives that are open to many interpretations - thus, the quintessential "dirty analysis" is the anthropological monograph's thick descriptions that present not just one, but many explanations of the  "how and why" for any given cultural phenomenon.
