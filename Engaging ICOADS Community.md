##Studying the ICOADS Community
<br> 
My work with the ICOADS community began as an Advanced Study Research fellow at NCAR in the summer of 2012. I used NOAA's defunding of ESRL as a critical incident \cite{flanagan1954critical} to ask questions about how  the community of ICOADS users would be impacted by these events, and how the loss of funds would change the development of a planned third release of ICOADS [3](#3). 

My initial work on these questions took a very traditional Information Science approach in using scientometric techniques to evaluate the impact of federally funded research projects \cite{geisler2000metrics,lane201421}.  Each of these studies were collaborations between NCAR software engineers, project scientists at NCAR, and colleagues at the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS). However, I assumed the full responsibility for designing each study, conducting the majority of all data analysis, and authoring the resulting publications.
