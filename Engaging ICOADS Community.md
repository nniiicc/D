##Studying the ICOADS Community
<br> 
My work with the ICOADS community began as an Advanced Study Research fellow at NCAR in the summer of 2012. I used NOAA's defunding of ESRL as a critical incident \cite{flanagan1954critical} to ask questions about how science and technology policy, at a broad level, impacted the functioning of an otherwise highly successful cooperative project, in what ways the community of ICOADS users were impacted by these events, and how the loss of funds would change the development of a third release of ICOADS [3](#3). 

My initial work on these questions took a very traditional Information Science approach in using scientometric techniques for the evaluation of science and technology policy (Geisler, 2000; Lane, Largent and Rosen, 2014).  Each of these studies were collaborations between NCAR software engineers, and project scientists at NCAR - as well colleagues at the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS). However, I assumed the full responsibility of designing each study, conducting the majority of all data analysis, and authoring the resulting publications.
