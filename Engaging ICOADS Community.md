##Studying the ICOADS Community
<br>
My work with the ICOADS community began as an Advanced Study Research fellow at NCAR in the summer of 2012. I used NOAA's defunding of ESRL as a critical incidient \cite{flanagan1954critical} to ask questions about how science and technology policy, at a broad level, impacted the functioning of an otherwise highly succesfull cooperative project, in what ways the community of ICOADS users were impacted by these events, and how the loss of funds impacted the development of a third release of ICOADS [3](#3). 

My intial work on these questions took a very traditional information science approach; in collaboration with NCAR software engineers and a co-PI on the ICOADS project I conducted two scientometric studies. 

The first 

(d(u) / r(u))/\sum_{1}^{n}{d}/\sum_{1}^{n}{r}

The impact of ICOADS couldnt be located in user logs, or citation analysis - it was an emergent property of the services, curation, documentation, 

As a I continued to study this community and work alongside 

, my study of ICOADS and the impact of federal funding took a very different turn - instead of trying to answer questions about how individual funding deceisions impacted users 

I sought to understand how ICOADS as an instutition was able to overcome these events 

How, the management, sharing 

In my interactions with ICOADS community membmers, I began to see their reactions not so much in terms of a community of practice impacted that would be devestated by the politcalization of climate science research, but an institution that solved collective action problems of this variety, over and over again. That through the pooling and sharing of resources they were able to sustain the type of work that allowed ICOADS to be a succesful data and software product to the climate science community for thirty years. 

Parallels between how new releases of ICOADS were "peer produced" seemed to mimic those found in other collective action institutions like the physical resource management of Lobster Fisheries () and digital communities like  Wikipedia,  and yet ICOADS seemed to differ in important ways - it was 

What was novel about this community as well was its history - wikipedia, FLOSSS etc. are peer production commons that have existed for a little over a decade - ICOADS 

In the next chapter I define a number of terms that have been used informally in the Chapter 1 - such as peer production, collective action, and commons - to describe ICOADS. I explain the ways that review literature f
