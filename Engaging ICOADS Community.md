##Studying the ICOADS Community
<br>
My work with the ICOADS community began as an Advanced Study Research fellow at NCAR in the summer of 2012. I used NOAA's defunding of ESRL as a critical incidient \cite{flanagan1954critical} to ask questions about how science and technology policy, at a broad level, impacted the functioning of an otherwise highly succesfull cooperative project, in what ways the community of ICOADS users were impacted by these events, and how the loss of funds impacted the development of a third release of ICOADS [3](#3). 

My intial work on these questions took a very traditional information science approach; in collaboration with NCAR software engineers and a co-PI on the ICOADS project I conducted two scientometric studies.
