##This proposal


The first two studies presented in chapter two fit the right form of this matrix - both use emprically clean methods, but differ in their presentation and interpreatio of the results. In the Data Usage Index, we used data which were publically available, and a set of adapted, but well accepted meaures of impact for 

Hits every cell in the matrix. 

Study one used tradtional clean and thin
Study two used dirty and thin

These helped me clarify and generate hypothesis which are important to the conducting of a case study

The case study uses the dirty and thick

The cell least understood and most important is the clean and thick - the framework generation. 

Next, I offer a brief but important point of clarification between frameworks, theories and models.
