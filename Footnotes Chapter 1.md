**Footnotes Chapter 1**
<br>

<a id="chapter-1">1</a>: Sea surface flux measurements are those that are taken at the interface of the ocean and atmosphere (e.g. sea-surface temperature, sea-level pressure, etc)

<a id="2">2</a>: For example, Thompson et al. were able to use the metadata from ICOADS to determine that interdecadal cooling from 1940-50 found in sea surface temperature (sst) records was the result of a change in measuring instruments not actual observations (2008).  

<a id="3">3</a>: Much like software, releases of ICOADS are numbered - with decimal places used to signify incrimental changes (i.e. 2.5), while major new releases are given a new number (i.e. 3.0).

<a id="3">3</a>: The index score is a Usage Impact Factor score which <a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=(d(u)&space;/&space;r(u))/\sum_{1}^{n}{d}/\sum_{1}^{n}{r}" target="_blank"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(d(u)&space;/&space;r(u))/\sum_{1}^{n}{d}/\sum_{1}^{n}{r}" title="(d(u) / r(u))/\sum_{1}^{n}{d}/\sum_{1}^{n}{r}" /></a>
