**Footnotes Chapter 2**
<br>

<a id="chapter-1">1</a>: Sea surface flux measurements are taken at the interface of the ocean and atmosphere (e.g. sea-surface temperature, sea-level pressure, etc)

<a id="2">2</a>: For example, Thompson et al. were able to use the metadata from ICOADS to determine that interdecadal cooling from 1940-50 found in sea surface temperature (sst) records was the result of a change in measuring instruments not actual observations (2008).  

<a id="3">3</a>: Much like software, releases of ICOADS are numbered - with decimal places used to signify incrimental changes (i.e. 2.5), while major new releases are given a new number (i.e. 3.0).

<a id="4">4</a>: Both metrics are adapted from the work of Ingwersen and Chavan (2011).
