<a id="chapter-1">1</a>: Sea surface flux measurements are those that are taken at the interface of the ocean and atmosphere (e.g. sea-surface temperature, sea-level pressure, etc)

<a id="2">2</a>: For example, Thompson et al. were able to use the metadata from ICOADS to determine that interdecadal cooling from 1940-50 found in sea surface temperature (sst) records was the result of a change in measuring instruments not actual observations (2008).
