##Frameworks, Theories, and Models

Next, I offer a brief but important point of clarification between frameworks, theories and models.

+ A **Frameworks** can mean different things to different fields engaged in social science work. For the sake of this dissertation, “Frameworks provide a meta-theoretical language that can be used to compare theories. They attempt to identify the universal elements that any theory relevant to the same kind of phenomena needs to include.” (Ostrom, 2011, p. 8). Frameworks aren’t a model, nor are they are a theory. They provide a structured and consistent set of variables to be either explained by or extended in the study of a given phenomenon. Frameworks allow for new theories to emerge, and existing theories to be applied in an attempt to make sense of a given situation. Institutional scholars traditionally define these concepts rigidly, as follows: Frameworks identify, categorize, and organize those factors deemed most relevant to understanding a phenomenon. 

+ **Theories** posit general causal relationships among some subsets of these variables or categories of factors, designating some types of factors as especially important and others as less critical for explanatory purposes. Theories are used to focus in on one more parts of a framework in order to “diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, or predict its outcomes…” (Ostrom , 1990, p. 28-29). I take theories that have different kinds of powers – descriptive; rhetorical; inferential; as well as having different froms of application \cite{halverson2002activity}. Each of these powers are emphasized or demoted based on the systematic gathering of data that a framework enables. 

+ **Models** specify the specific functional relationships among particular variables or indicators that are hypothesized to operate in some well-defined set of conditions. 
( McGinnis, 2013)

To understand the way that these three concepts fit together Ostrom explains that “One needs a common framework and family of theories in order to address questions of reforms and transitions.” (1990, p. 29). If a study is concerned with change over time, or with the evolution of some form of collective action then its necessary to both use a variety of methodological approaches for gathering data, as well as a common framework to organize the data and apply a family of theories– each of which may have a different power for helping make sense of a complex phenomenon. For instance, Howison and Crowston support the pragmatic theory building behind their work on "open super-position" through participant observation, archival documentation, trace analysis, etc. using previous theories of collaboration and organizing to situate their findings as inferential and applicative power (2014).

This work presented in this proposal and the completed dissertation will be  concerned, almost entirely, with developing a framework for analyzing sociotechnical systems, their sustainbility, and their processes of solving collective action problems that arise from the pooling and sharing of research objects. Although future steps should surely include the types of theory building that are necessary to explain the variables collected by this framework, it remains beyond the scope and the ambition of my work here.
