##ICOADS Background 
<br>
The International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS) is a cooperative project that curates historical and contemporary marine data. The project was initiated in 1984 by researchers at the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL), the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Over time the project grew to include international collaborators such as the Joint World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)–Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) and the Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM).

By bringing together resources that were scattered in national meteorological offices and naval archives ICOADS was originally developed to be an authoritative and comprehensive marine dataset that could be used in global climate studies (Fletcher et al. 1984). As the project advanced from collecting synoptic charts and tape reels to processing and developing statistical summary data products, it became clear that the documentation, software and services that were integral to using ICOADS would make it not so much a dataset, but a "...readily accessible archive of global climate information." (Woodruff et al., 1986)

In its current form, ICOADS is an international cooperative project to curate, develop and serve quality controlled data, metadata, historical documentation, software, and models to researchers interested in sea-surface flux variables [^ssf]. Data come from a variety of sources, including the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), in-situ measurements taken by researchers at sea, earth observing satellites, as well as drifting and moored buoys. ICOADS value however is not the aggregation and curation of contemporary earth observing instrument data, but in the historical records recovered from "ships of opportunity" - that is, logbooks that recorded weather events during military, shipping, and even whaling voyages during the 17th, 18th and 19th century. 

Data extracted from digitized historical logbooks are treated systematically, meaning that ICOADS curators are "preserving data source identification and measurement metadata with each record, and converting units and coding schemes to a uniform set" (Woodruff et al. 2011, p. 951) Digitied data are integrated with existing observations to create statistically summarized data products that fit a 2˚ x 2˚ grid. The first release of COADS data products contained 73 million records with dates reaching back to 1852. As more shipping records have been discovered and digitized the coverage of ICOADS has been extended to 1662 and now includes more than 261 million historical and contemporary records.
