##ICOADS Funding
<br>
ICOADS has, from its very beginnings, struggled to attract funding. As a preface to the first release of COADS one of the principle investigators noted that "It has taken four years and much effort by many individuals and several institutions to obtain and process the hundreds of tapes containing the basic data input. All of this effort was provided from ongoing activities; there was no appropriation identified for the task. It is a tribute to the spirit of cooperation among the participating organizations that the task has been successfully completed." (Slutz et al., 1985) As a result of this struggle, the developers of ICOADS release 1.0 committed to making all of its products (data, software, etc.) freely available to the climate science community (Woodruff et al, 1987). 

Free and open access to ICOADS has helped ICOADS become recognized by the climate community as  "the most complete and heterogeneous collection of surface marine data in existence" (Woodruff et al. 2011). ICOADS data have been used extensively in earth systems science research, international climate assessment reports such as the IPCC, as well as being a fundamental component of reanalysis projects that combine historical weather observations with climate data to create authoritative, homogenous datasets for climate monitoring communities (Kalnay et al. ,1996).

The most recent struggle for funding came in January of 2012, when a notice was sent to ICOADS partners announcing that, "For budgetary reasons, stemming from pending large cuts at the NOAA Climate Program Office (CPO), ESRL Directors have determined that it is no longer feasible for its Physical Science Division (PSD) to continue supporting any further ICOADS workâ€”effective immediately."
