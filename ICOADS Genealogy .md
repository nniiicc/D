###ICOADS Genealogy 

The second study that we conducted attempted to trace the genealogy of ICOADS and its derivative products. While there exists rich provenance information for the records that are used to assemble ICOADS, very little is known about how and to what extent ICOADS is used in secondary data products \cite{worley2012data}. Our work was aimed at formalizing qualitative observations from ICOADS data curators about the importance or of early ICOADS releases for subsequent marine climatology data products, and climate science data more generally. Previous work at tracing the citations made to papers describing ICOADS datasets had failed to produce robust evidence of their impact, and led to us asking how and to what extent ICOADS data had been used - not in published research, but in developing secondary data products (Weber, Worley and Mayernik, 2014a, 2014b).
