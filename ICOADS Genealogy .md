###ICOADS Genealogy 

The second study that we conducted attempted to trace the geneaology of ICOADS and its derivative products. While there exists rich provenance information for the records that are used to assemble ICOADS, very little is known about how and to what extent ICOADS is used in secondary data products \cite{worley2012data}. Our work was aimed at formalizing qualitative observations from ICOADS data curators about the importance or of early ICOADS releases for marine climatology, and climate science data more generally.
