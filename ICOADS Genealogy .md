###ICOADS Genealogy 

The second study that we conducted attempted to trace the geneaology of ICOADS and its derivative products. As described in the background section, provenance information for ICOADS (typically in the form of metadata about ships) offer a detailed and important look at how the dataset was assembled at each stage of a new release, but this metadata often fails to fully account for how data have changed between releases \cite{worley2012data}. More importantly, the provenance metadata for ICOADS can't account for ways in which it has been used as a part of other derivative climate data products (Kent et al., 2007).
