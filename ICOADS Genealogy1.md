To trace the genealogy of ICOADS, we searched for metadata records harvested by NASA's Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) using the ISO 19115 standard. We used queries related to ICOADS such as "International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Dataset" or "I.C.O.A.D.S" to locate as many ICOADS records as possible. In total, we discovered 99 records, of which only 23 represented different versions or subsets of the ICOADS project. This means that the remaining 76 records represented derivatives or offspring of ICOADS. 

We then extracted potentially informative fields from the metadata records. The fields harvested included: Entry Title, Entry ID, Summary, Geographic Coverage, Start Date, End Date, Geographic Resolution, Temporal Resolution, Scientific Keywords (often dataset parameters), Geographic Keywords, Sources (platform of data collection), and Instruments. Eeach field was then converted into binary codes for “presence” or absence” of individual keywords (Figure 5). In some cases we coded additional “presence” or “absence” of characters based on the free text summaries of the records (for instance, in some cases, resolution was stated in the free text “Summary” field but not the “Geographic Resolution” field).
