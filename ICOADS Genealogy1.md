To trace the genealogy of ICOADS, we first searched metadata records harvested by NASA's Global Change Master Directory (GCMD). The GCMD harvests metadata from federal repositories using the ISO 19115 standard - and allows users to perform free text queries against this data. We were able to locate 99 records related to ICOADS, of which only 23 represented different versions or subsets of the ICOADS project. This means that the remaining 76 records represented derivatives or offspring of ICOADS. 

We then extract potentially informative fields from the metadata records. The fields harvested included: Entry Title, Entry ID, Summary, Geographic Coverage, Start Date, End Date, Geographic Resolution, Temporal Resolution, Scientific Keywords (often dataset parameters), Geographic Keywords, Sources (platform of data collection), and Instruments. 

Once collected, each field was converted into binary codes for “presence” or absence” of individual keywords (Figure 2). In some cases we coded additional “presence” or “absence” of characters based on the free text summaries of the records (for instance, in some cases, resolution was stated in the free text “Summary” field but not the “Geographic Resolution” field).
