With the coded data, we then produced a maximum likelihood (ML) tree (Felsenstein 1981), by utilizing a statistical model specifically designed for use with morphological, or presence/absence data (Lewis, 2001). The assumption that we were making in this process is that significant properties or characteristics of the metadata records that we were coding could be clustered - such that data products that shared similar traits could be grouped together in the same way that similar species are grouped together in a phylogenetic analysis (for a complete discussion of this work see Thomer and Weber, 2014; Weber, Thomer and Worley, 2014).
