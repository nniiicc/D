With the coded data, we then produced a maximum likelihood (ML) tree (Felsenstein 1981), by utilizing a statistical model specifically designed for use with morphological, or presence/absence data (Lewis, 2001). The assumption that we were making in this process is that significant properties or characteristics of the metadata records that we were coding could be clustered - such that data products that shared similar traits could be grouped together in the same way that similar species are grouped together in a phylogenetic analysis (for a complete discussion of this work see Thomer and Weber, 2014; Weber, Thomer and Worley, 2014). 

To engage the ICOADS community in this work, we presented a poster at the 6th CLIMAR workshop on marine climatology in Asheville, North Carolina. We asked participants to write on the poster - giving us feedback about what datasets were missing, which datasets were or should be related to others, and what if anything was helpful about visualizing the heredity of ICOADS in this way. 

The feedback we recieved from many people was, to say the least, shock at what was missing. Many used their phones to look up metadata in the GCMD to make sure we were correct - and then failing to find any reference to ICOADS, many went back to their own data products metadata to understand  becuase as accurate as our methods had been, the truth was many datasets harvested by GCMD were missing any reference to ICOADS.
