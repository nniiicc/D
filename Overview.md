##Overview

In **chapter one** I describe two influential views of organizing, managing and funding knowledge production in basic science research; I refer to these two approaches as the cynical and the sentimental. I then describe how and why the cynical and the sentimental models are incompatible with the kinds of broad cooperation required to sustain collaborations that share and pool resources over long periods of time. 

Next, I provide a brief background on the International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS), which will be used as case study in this dissertation. I then describe my work with this community over the last two years, including a set of published studies of ICOADS impact, value and evolution. Building on the findings of this work, I state three research questions to be answered by this dissertation.

In **chapter two** I review research literature on collective action, peer production, and shared governance of common pool resources from the fields of economics and political science. I demonstrate that many of the findings from this body of research are compatible with studies of data sharing, reuse and cyberinfrastructure development found in information science and CSCW.  

I use these overlaps to suggest that an analytical framework for studying the evolution and sustainability of sociotechnical systems, like ICOADS, should be developed to better understand the complex political, social and economic settings in which they are embedded.

In **chapter three** I describe the methods I have used to conduct a case study of ICOADS. I outline the form that the completed case study will take and its contribution to our understanding of the sustainability of institutions for collective action. 

I then review a number of different analytical frameworks that have been used, in part, to study the sustainability of cooperative institutions in political science, cultural heritage studies, human computer interaction, and information science. I outline a proposal for a framework to analyze the sustainability of sociotechnical systems. In the completed dissertation I will apply this framework to ICOADS, and discuss its success and limitations as a diagnostic tool.   

I conclude with a discussion of my intended audience, the limitations to the work I have proposed, and a schedule for completion of the dissertation.
