##Peer Production

"The freedom to operate that marks peer production, and the full organizational permeability of the practices, allow anyone with a potential to contribute to self-assign, experiment with resources, projects, and collaborations, and test the improvement produced in these experiments." (Benkler, 2013 p. 23)

Collective action in open science has been studied in a variety of settings, most notably as it relates to the emerging phenomena of eScience, or cyberinfrastructures  (Olson, Zimmerman and Bos 2007; Hey, Tansley and Tolle, 2009). As Jirotka, Lee and Olson (2013) point out the new possibilities for connecting disciplines through cyberinfrastructure (in the USA) or eScience applications (in the UK) have been broadly covered in at least six full length books on the subject (Hine 2006; Jankowski 2009; Nentwich 2003; Olson et al. 2008a; Parker et al. 2010; Dutton and Jeffreys 2010). There are many observations that could be made about this impact, but for the sake of this dissertation I  focus on how the Internet as an information communication technology (ICT) has transformed the distribution of labor needed to tackle complex, systems based problems through “peer-production” in an open science paradigm.  

The Internet has enabled the traditional division of labor to be re-calibrated for efficient use of existing models or organizing (i.e. Post-Fordism), but it has also created an alternative mode of organizing projects by enabling the distribution of tasks outside these traditional models, "The networked environment not only provides a more effective platform for action to nonprofit organizations that organize action like firms, or to hobbyists who merely coexist coordinately. It also provides a platform for new mechanisms for widely dispersed agents to adopt radically decentralized cooperation strategies other than by using proprietary and contractual claims to elicit prices or impose managerial commands." (Benkler, 2006 p. 21)

The decentralized and non-proprietary phenomena of organizing work on the internet found early success in  Free / Open Source Software projects, such as Linux and Apache. What confounded organizational scholars (Lachine and Von Hippel, 2003; Lakhani and Wolf, 2005) and economists (Lerner and Tirole, 2002; Hars and Ou, 2001) studying the massive success of these projects was that people who were paid worked alongside volunteers, in an almost non-hierarchical manor – each type of contributor exhibiting equal passion, dedication, and feelings of ownership for the project. This seemed to violate certain basic assumptions of equality, reciprocity and incentives about work, and labor that economists had held for decades if not centuries (Benkler, 2004). The finding repeated throughout this body of literature is that FL/OSS participants aren’t some wholly new breed of altruistic worker – but that “interests” and “preferences” were much more diverse than simply monetary incentives. Freedom to reap rewards of one’s own work, the prospect of future employment, status within a community, reciprocity for help with their own projects, activism, and simply wanting interesting problems to solve were all key incentives to the successful organization of an open source project (Scheick, 2007).

Benkler describes these projects as a model of “peer-production” 

>a form of open creation and sharing performed by groups online that: set and execute goals in a decentralized manner; harness a diverse range of participant motivations, particularly non-monetary motivations; and separate governance and management relations from exclusive forms of property and relational contracts (i.e., projects are governed as open commons or common property regimes and organizational governance utilizes combinations of participatory, meritocratic and charismatic, rather than proprietary or contractual, models).
