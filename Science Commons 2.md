In a science commons, a distinction between rivalry in access, and rivalry in use is important to clarify. In some sense, two individuals might both be able to obtain the same set of data from the same commons, but the very fact that both have the data and have the ability to draw similar conclusions does not necessary limit the value of that dataset. In the case of ICOADS the “raw” nature of marine climatology data creates a need to further process the data in order to derive any substantive meaning from it. Therefore, mutual ownership does not in any way lessen it’s value – just as the mutual downloading of the same document from the same institutional repository does not mean that two individuals will necessarily be able to draw the same conclusions from the text.

In a series of “in-depth interviews” with principle investigators of eScience projects in the UK,  Fry, Schroder and  den Bensten investigated “research governance at the institutional level and local research practices at the project level.” (2008, p.6) Their work asked about both the sustainability of these models, and further, to what extent they promoted openness in sharing research products and collaborating. The conclude in the following way, “The fundamental challenge in resolving openness in practice and policy, and thereby moving towards a sustainable infrastructure for e-Science, is the coordination and integration of goals across e-Science efforts, rather than one of resolving IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) issues, which has been the central focus of openness debates thus far.”  (2008, p.6). 

Fry, Schroder and den Bensten also note that they identified a number of conflicts between contractual governance at a micro-level and project settings (institutional contexts) at a macro-level – which introduced uncertainty for the sustainability and trust between different collaborators. They conclude “ Such a schism may be because contractual and institutional arrangements in science have traditionally focused on final products (or outcomes) of projects such as publications, compounds or genes, rather than engaging at the level of knowledge creation. This is a particular issue for e-Research as there is more of an impetus to disseminate and share by-products such as software code and data not used in final results.” (2008, p. 23) 

Many of this study’s concerns (sustainability, incentive to coordinate work, governance of institutions at multiple scales) should bear directly upon the research project that I am proposing, and yet for all of the discussion of common resources and community infrastructures, there is absolutely no discussion of a long history of studying common-pool resources, or commons solutions to collective action dilemmas. This isn’t to point out a shortcoming as much as an opportunity to bring the knowledge of these studies to bear on contemporary eScience problems – because, should sound eerily familiar to the types of problems that Ostrom sought to address in her study of Spanish huertas, and the solutions she recongnzied in polycentric approaches that nested institutional governance structures within smaller, local communities. 

There are undoubtedly novel or at least unique twists on the types of collective action dilemmas faced by eScience, cyberifnrasttructure developers, or whatever we want to refer to a contemporary data-intensive, software-dependent, computationally-driven practices in basic science research. But, as many of the data sharing studies reveal there is much shared in the problems faced by these actors, and there is just as likely to be shared solutions to designing and intervening in these types of institutional arrangements.
