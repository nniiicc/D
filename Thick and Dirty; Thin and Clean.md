##Thick & Dirty; Thin & Clean

At the intersection of these two dimensions – dirty and clean, and thick and thin-  is where we can locate most social science research projects. 

+ For instance, a traditional scientometric study in Information Science will use quantitative data to answer very narrowly defined research questions, a narrowly defined theory of interpretation, and present the analysis of this data in a structured publication, In other words, it is the quintessential descriptively thin and empirically clean research project.

+ Ethnographic, or historical studies that take the observation of human action, the study of archival documents or the words of interview participants as data will fit the descriptively thick and empirically dirty category by answering broad research questions in a rich narrative that is discursive and unstructured in form.

To return to research projects described chapter two, Vertesi and Dourish's study of "data economies" is an **empirically dirty and descriptively thick** study of value. The authors present in rich detail the different strategies and motivations for sharing data among two research teams working at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2011). The results of this work take the form of broad "implications" for the design of a future data management system, and Vertesi and Dourish advocate for policies that remove mandates about how or when data should be shared between collaborative teams of researchers at JPL. In the language of commons researchers discussed chapter 2, Vertesi and Dourish are doing field work that clarifies and makes recommendations for easing tensions that exist between rules-in-form and rules-in-use; but they are doing so through discursive arguments that are open to multiple interpretations. 

Bollen, Fox and Singhal’s study that described the benefit of supercomputer access to TeraGrid researchers is an **empirically clean and descriptively thin** research project, answering questions such as;
 
> Do mostly high-impact scientists benefit from the TeraGrid? 

> Are some scientific domains more strongly represented than others in TeraGrid-supported work? (2010). 

By using highly normalized, and openly accessible citation data the findings presented by Bollen, Fox and Singhal are validated through their use of established statistical tests. While these results offer easily digestible "proof" that the TeraGrid infrastructure has produced papers with higher citation rates than those that did not, their thin description of this phenomena offers few details about how, or why the TeraGrid publications have had an impact on the geoscience research community; as the authors state, “TeraGrid usage is indeed significantly correlated with the scientific impact of its users, but the causal direction of this relation remains unclear.” (2010, p. 11)
