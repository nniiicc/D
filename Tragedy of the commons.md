### Tragedy of the commons

Garret Hardin coined the phrase “tragedy of the commons” in an article published in Science (1968) in which he addressed the topic of human population growth. Hardin's article tries to provide a counter-point the “laissez faire” policies influenced, indirectly by Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” (1968, p. 1244). Hardin’s argument depends on a hypothetical collective action dilemma from an open grazing pasture. Desiring to maximize their wealth, each herdsman is said to ask himself “What is the utility in adding another animal to my herd?” As each individual is concerned with only his/her own well being, each herdsmen will naturally add another animal. 

Hardin uses this “rational” basis of decision making to define the dilemma of self organizing commons, saying:

>Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit-in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all. (1968, p. 1244).

Hardin uses the “tragedy of the commons” to position enclosure (privatization), or hierarchical governments as the only two solutions to collective action problems. 


The tragedy of the commons has, since Hardin's writing, become a kind of shorthand for the free-rider problem.
